<h3>Effective Pedagogy</h3>

<p>I'm keen to understand how I can be a more impactful educator. I am interested in effective pedagogy and I push myself to explore different learning strategies and formats for my classes.</p>

<p>Many of the <a href="" hx-get="pages/show.html">teaching tools and resources</a> I have developed for my classroom over the years are based on teaching and learning strategies I have read about, and wish to put into practice.</p>
