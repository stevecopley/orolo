<h2>Not Work</h2>

<h3>I Ride Bikes</h3>

<p>I've loved riding bikes all of my life. I discovered mountain biking whilst at university in 1986, and I've been riding trails ever since.</p>

<p>It's fair to say that MTBs have been a major part of my adult life, leading to many great friendships, and some amazing adventures. I can't imagine not riding bikes. I commute to work by bike every day and never tire of it.</p>

<p>Amongst my too-large collection of bikes you will find a couple of notable bikes:</p>

            <th>Yeti SB150</th>
            <td>A modern, carbon MTB, my <a href="https://yeticycles.com/bikes/sb150" target="_blank">SB150</a> is fully kitted out with Hope components, carbon wheels, etc. It's beautiful and I love it. It's the perfect bike for the <a href="https://www.trailforks.com/region/nelson-5259/" target="_blank">trails around Nelson</a>.</td>

            https://www.facebook.com/gmbntech/videos/pace-rc200-f2-retro-mtb/868701584010668/" target="_blank">awesome MTBs</a> back in the 90s. I used to race for a shop team and this Pace is my team bike. Anodised aqua-blue, it's tricked out with purple and red 90s parts, and for a 30-year-old bike it looks amazing!</td>

<h3>I Read Books</h3>

<p>Losing myself in a good book is a pretty great way to relax. Some of my favourite authors:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Neal Stephenson</dt>
    <dd>Some of the most thoughtful, interesting and nerdy books you'll find. I've read <a href="http://www.nealstephenson.com/books/" target="_blank">every book</a> of his, multiple times. If I have to pick a favourite, it's probably <em>Cryptonomicon</em>, closely followed by the epic trilogy of <em>The Baroque Cycle</em>.</dd>

    <dt>Philip Pullman</dt>
    <dd>I have been enamoured by the world of <a href="https://www.philip-pullman.com/hdm" target="_blank">His Dark Materials</a> for years, even to the point that I wanted to call my daughter 'Lyra'! The richness of the storytelling and the drama of the themes make for compelling reading. I have also enjoyed many other title of his.</dd>

    <dt>Peter Carey</dt>
    <dd><a href="http://petercareybooks.com/all-titles/" target="_blank">His books</a> are deep; full of life and love, joy and sadness. Some have brought me genuine happiness; others have brought me real pain. My first read of <em>Oscar and Lucinda</em> was completed at 4am one morning, having been unable to put it down. It left me broken.</dd>
