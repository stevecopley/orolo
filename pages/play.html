<h3>I Ride Bikes</h3>

<p>I've loved riding bikes all of my life. I discovered mountain biking whilst at university in 1986, and I've been riding trails ever since. It's fair to say that MTBs have been a major part of my adult life, leading to many great friendships, and some amazing adventures.</p>

<p>I presently ride a <a href="https://yeticycles.com/bikes/sb150">Yeti SB150</a>, fully kitted out with Hope components, carbon wheels, etc. It's beautiful and I love it. It's the perfect bike for the <a href="https://www.trailforks.com/region/nelson-5259/">trails around Nelson</a>.</p>

<h3>I Read Books</h3>

<p>Losing myself in a good book is a pretty great way to relax. Some of my favourite authors:</p>
