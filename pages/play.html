<h2>Not Work</h2>

<p>So many things I love to do, and not enough time to pack it all in!</p>

<p>Playing with my kids, hiking, camping, swimming in rivers, building things, travelling, looking at art, laying in my hammock, eating cake. Life is good when these things are part of it.</p>

<p>Here are some of the things that have played a huge part in my life...</p>


<h3>I Ride Bikes</h3>

<p>I've loved riding bikes all of my life. I discovered mountain biking whilst at university in 1986, and I've been riding trails ever since.</p>

<p>It's fair to say that MTBs have been a major part of my adult life, leading to many great friendships, and some amazing adventures. I can't imagine not riding bikes. I commute to work by bike every day and never tire of it.</p>

<p>Amongst my too-large collection of bikes you will find a couple of notable bikes:</p>

                <h4>Yeti SB150</h4>

                My <a href="https://yeticycles.com/bikes/sb150" target="_blank">SB150</a> is beautiful and I love it. It's fully blinged out and is the perfect bike for smashing down the <a href="https://www.trailforks.com/region/nelson-5259/" target="_blank">trails around Nelson</a>.

<h3>I Read Books</h3>

<p>Losing myself in a good book is time well spent. Some of my favourite authors:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Neal Stephenson</dt>
    <dd>Some of the most thoughtful, interesting and nerdy <a href="http://www.nealstephenson.com/books/" target="_blank">books</a> you'll find. If I have to pick a favourite, it's probably <em>Cryptonomicon</em>, closely followed by the epic trilogy of <em>The Baroque Cycle</em>.</dd>

    <dt>Philip Pullman</dt>
    <dd>The world of <a href="https://www.philip-pullman.com/hdm" target="_blank">His Dark Materials</a> is dark and wonderful. The richness of the storytelling and the drama of the themes make for compelling reading. I almost called my daughter 'Lyra' after the protagonist!</dd>

    <dt>Peter Carey</dt>
    <dd><a href="http://petercareybooks.com/all-titles/" target="_blank">His books</a> are deep, full of life and love, joy and sadness. My first read of <em>Oscar and Lucinda</em> was completed at 4am one morning, having been unable to put it down; it left me bereft.</dd>

<h3>I Listen to Music</h3>

<p>Music has been a feature of every part of my life. I can't begin to list all of the wonderful artists and music I have enjoyed over the years, but a few that come to mind are:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Radiohead</dt>
    <dd>Thom Yorke's voice and vocals have always moved me. First saw them live <a href="https://archive.org/details/Radiohead_1995-11-01/" target="_blank">in 1995 at the Town & Country Club</a> in Leeds and they blew me away.</dd>

    <dt>REM</dt>
    <dd>Quite the <a href="https://remhq.com/music/" target="_blank">catalogue of amazing albums</a> from this awesome band. A friend introduced me to a bunch of US alt-rock music in the late 80s, and I'm glad he did.</dd>

    <dt>Foo Fighters</dt>
    <dd>Stadium-filling rock superstars now, but I was lucky enough to see them at a small venue in Leeds back in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ju8VI69DFI0" target="_blank">1995</a> and again in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4rdhEzARbc" target="_blank">1997</a>. Been following them since.</dd>

    <dt>Banging House Tunes!</dt>
    <dd>Spent a lot of weekends in the late 90s dancing the night away with friends. It's how I met my wife! Fun times, and I listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0-hvjV2A5Y" target="_blank">some bangers</a> still gets my foot tapping.</dd>
</dl>


<h3>I Nerd Out</h3>

<p>Technology, and computers in particular, have been part of my life since the early 1980s: Programming a Commodore PET that a friend's dad had bought home from work, helping my Science teacher build a <a href="https://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/3653/Nascom-2/" target="_blank">Nascom 2</a> from a kit, saving up for a ZX Spectrum... I've been a nerd for years!</p>

<p>I have a collection of 1980s and 1990s computer technology in my office - I'm a real sucker for the nostalgia of beige plastic!</p>
