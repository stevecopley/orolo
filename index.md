### I'm Steve Copley...

Father, teacher, mountain biker, nerd.

I love coffee, bikes, creating things, adventures in the hills, lie-ins, video games and good books.

I Live in [Nelson](https://www.nelsontasman.nz) at the top of the South Island of New Zealand, and I work at [Waimea College](https://www.waimea.school.nz) as the Digital Learning Co-ordinator and Teacher in Charge of Digital Technologies. My full [bio is here](/bio.html).

## I Code

I code up solutions to problems now and then, as well a creating resources for my teaching. You can find me on GitHub: [@waimea-cpy](https://github.com/waimea-cpy) for work stuff, and [@stevecopley](https://github.com/stevecopley) for personal projects. Don't go looking there for pro-level code - it's all written by someone who barely knows what he's doing!

Here are a few projects I've worked on recently...

## I Web

I've designed and coded a lot of websites over the years (the first I can remember running for friends was back in 1998).

Today, these are the sites that I actively maintain...
