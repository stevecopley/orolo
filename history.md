{% capture part1 %}

Born in London in the UK, grew up in Kent and also lived in Hull and Leeds. Educated as an Electronic Engineer, graduating in 1990 with an honours degree. Wrote code for a living for some years (mostly C, with some Delphi). Later retrained as a teacher of Design & Technology. 

Taught GCSE and A-Level D&T and ICT in Leeds for almost a decade. Married my awesome wife in 2002. Moved to the tropical island of Mah√© in [Seychelles](https://www.seychelles.com) shortly after. Worked at [The International School](https://iss.sc/) for five years, initially as a teacher of IGCSE and A-Level ICT, and then as Head of Secondary Section. A wonderful place.

Moved to [Kuwait](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait) in 2007 to top up our savings. Spent five years teaching at The English Academy. Our daughter was born in Kuwait in 2011.

Emigrated to [New Zealand](https://www.newzealand.com/int/) in 2013. Employed as Head of Digital Technologies at [Tauranga Boys' College](https://www.tbc.school.nz) for five years. Our son was born in Tauranga in 2017. 

In 2018 we moved to [Nelson](https://www.nelsontasman.nz) in the South Island where we intend to stay. It's a pretty great place to live, work and raise a family.
